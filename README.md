# Audio Modifier Rust (Project Jason)
A simple realtime audio modifier program for me to play with audio modifications at low level processing.

Feel free to clone and play around, maybe even create and add your own modifiers.

## TODO:
- Add realtime EQ visualization of each frame
- Add more voice modifiers
- Make switching voice modifiers on and off more seamless
